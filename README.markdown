Rhizome is a library for visualizing graph and tree structures.

## Usage

To include in your project, add this to your `project.clj`:

```clj
[rhizome "0.1.4"]
```


Use of this project requires that [Graphviz](http://www.graphviz.org) is installed, which can be checked by running `dot -V` at the command line.  If it's not installed, you can do the following:

| platform | directions |
|----------|------------|
| Linux | install `graphviz` using your package manager |
| OS X | [download the installer](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_macos.php) |
| Windows |  [download the installer](http://www.graphviz.org/Download_windows.php) |

There are two namespaces, `rhizome.dot` and `rhizome.viz`.  The former will take a graph and return a string representation of a Graphviz dot file, the latter takes graphs and renders or displays them.  In practice, you should only need to use `rhizome.viz`.

The core function is `rhizome.viz/view-graph`.  It takes two parameters: `nodes`, which is a list of nodes in the graph, and `adjacent`, which is a function that takes a node and returns adjacent nodes.  These can be followed by zero or more of the following keyword arguments:


| name | description |
|------|-------------|
| `:directed?` | whether the graph should be rendered as a directed graph, defaults to true |
| `:vertical?` | whether the graph should be rendered top-to-bottom, defaults to true |
| `:node->descriptor` | takes a node, and returns a map of attributes onto values describing how the node should be rendered |
| `:edge->descriptor` | takes the source and destination node, and returns a map of attributes onto values describing how the edge should be rendered |
| `:options` | a map of attributes onto values describing how the graph should be rendered |

The rendering attributes described by `:node->descriptor`, `:edge->descriptor`, and `:options` are described in detail [here](http://www.graphviz.org/content/attrs).  String and keyword values are interchangeable.

The most commonly-used attributes are `label`, which describes the text overlaid on a node or edge, and `shape`, the options for which are described [here](http://www.graphviz.org/content/node-shapes).  For the `:options`, it's sometimes useful to adjust the `dpi`, which controls the size of the image.

An example:

```clj
> (use 'rhizome.viz)
nil
> (def g
    {:a [:b :c]
	 :b [:c]
	 :c [:a]})
#'g
> (view-graph (keys g) g
    :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label n}))
```

While trees are a special case of graphs, using `view-graph` to visualize trees can be a little indirect.  To make this simpler, there's a `view-tree` function, which is modeled after Clojure's `tree-seq` operator.  This function takes three parameters, `branch?`, `children`, and `root`, followed by zero or more of the keyword arguments taken by `view-graph`.  This can make it easy to visualize hierarchical structures:

```clj
> (def t [[1 [2 3]] [4 [5]]])
#'t
> (view-tree sequential? seq t
    :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label (when (number? n) n)}))
```

If the value for `label` is not a string, typically it will be displayed as a string representation of the value.  However, if the value is sequential, then the node will be displayed as a `Record` type:

```clj
> (def t '([1 2] ([3 4] ([5 6 7]))))
#'t
> (view-tree list? seq t
    :node->descriptor (fn [n] {:label (when (vector? n) n)}))
```
